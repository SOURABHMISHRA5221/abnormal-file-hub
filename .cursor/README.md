# Cursor Rules Directory

This directory contains configuration and rules for the Cursor AI coding assistant used in the Abnormal File Hub project.

## Contents

- **rules.md** - The main rules file that defines:
  - Project context and architecture requirements
  - Workflow requirements for file changes
  - Code standards for Python, TypeScript, and Docker
  - Quality assurance procedures
  - Documentation requirements
  - Git workflow guidelines

## Purpose

These rules ensure that all changes made with Cursor AI assistance follow the project's standards and maintain consistent quality. The rules direct the assistant to:

1. Read and understand project architecture before making changes
2. Follow established code patterns and styles
3. Update documentation appropriately
4. Maintain test coverage
5. Follow proper Git workflow

## Usage

The rules in this directory are automatically loaded by Cursor AI when working in this repository. No additional configuration is needed.

## Updating Rules

When updating the rules, consider the following:

1. **Be explicit** - Clearly define requirements and expectations
2. **Be consistent** - Ensure rules don't contradict each other
3. **Provide context** - Include reasoning for important rules
4. **Be comprehensive** - Cover all aspects of development workflow

After updating rules, commit the changes and ensure all team members pull the latest version.
