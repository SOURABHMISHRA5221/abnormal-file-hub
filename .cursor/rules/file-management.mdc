# File Management Rules

When modifying files in this project, follow these guidelines:

## Actions After Code Changes
1. READ docs/architecture.mermaid to verify architectural compliance
2. UPDATE docs/status.md with:
   - Current progress
   - Any new issues encountered
   - Completed items
3. VALIDATE changes against docs/technical.md specifications
4. VERIFY task progress against tasks/tasks.md
5. COMMIT changes with descriptive messages

## Commit Standards
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference task IDs when applicable (e.g., "FILE-008: Add cursor ignore file")
- Group related changes in logical commits
- Verify your changes work before committing
