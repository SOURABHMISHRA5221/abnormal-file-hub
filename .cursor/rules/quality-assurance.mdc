# Quality Assurance

## Architecture Understanding
- Load and parse complete Mermaid diagrams in docs/architecture.mermaid
- Extract and understand:
  - Module boundaries and relationships
  - Data flow patterns
  - System interfaces
  - Component dependencies
- Validate any changes against architectural constraints
- Ensure new code maintains defined separation of concerns

## Error Prevention
- Verify type consistency
- Check for potential null/undefined
- Validate against business rules
- Ensure error handling
- Implement logging for errors
- Add transaction handling for database operations
- Test edge cases
- Validate user inputs

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure integration tests verify component interactions
- Test data validation edge cases
- Verify error handling works as expected
- Test performance for large files and bulk operations
- Run the full test suite before pushing any changes:
  ```
  # Backend tests
  cd backend
  python manage.py test
  
  # Frontend tests
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```
- Ensure code coverage remains above 80
